# Follow Me... Follow My Words

Old words sprout, then fade.

Renga plants an ancient seed.

Reflect, inspire, play.

### As a player ...
* I see words breath in and out of view inspiring a sense of calm and inspiration
   * I see words blossom into view, fade then fall.
   * I see words float from the top down like leaves or blossoms

* I see spaces for syllables on lines(575 or 77) showing me how this stanza should be structured.
* I see the last stanza set and/or the first stanza of the current so I can know what I'm creating.
* Clicking or touching one of the falling words places it in the next set of spaces.
* Clicking or touching a word lets it fall.
   * A released word can be touched again before it disappears from view
* When the text ends the game ends.
* Or when 100 or 36 stanzas are reached
